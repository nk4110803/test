- **tests/**: Automated tests for various units of the project.

⚙️ **Installation**  
Install the required libraries (recommended inside a virtual environment):

🔹 pip install -r client/requirements.txt

🚀 Running the Project

1️⃣ Start the Server
The server temporarily listens at http://127.0.0.1:8000/upload: 
 🔹 python -m uvicorn main:app --reload

2️⃣ Start the Client (Monitor)
The client performs an initial scan of the folder and then starts listening for changes: 
 🔹 python client/cli.py run "C:\path\to\your\folder"

🧪 Running Tests
The project uses pytest for testing.
To run all tests: 
 🔹 python -m pytest -q

🛠️ Key Features

Initial Scan: Scans the folder on every start and uploads files that changed while the system was offline.

Hash Validation: Uses SHA-256 to ensure only truly changed files are uploaded.

Clean Repo: Built-in .gitignore to prevent uploading junk files like __pycache__.
